/**
 * Case history — the substrate for time travel.
 *
 * A Case only ever holds its *current* state: `hypotheses` is a map mutated in
 * place, so once round 3 has run there is no record of what the differential
 * looked like at round 2. Reconstructing that from the event log is not
 * possible — events carry summaries, not probabilities.
 *
 * So we snapshot. After every step that changes the reasoning state we deep-copy
 * the mutable slice of the case and append it to `c.history`. The result is an
 * append-only tape the UI can scrub across: each entry is a complete, renderable
 * case state, so "show me round 2" is a lookup rather than a replay.
 *
 * A step, not a round, is the unit. A clinician entering a test result between
 * rounds changes the picture as much as a round does, and "what led us here"
 * reads wrong if those moments are missing. Every entry still carries its round
 * number, so the UI can label and group by round.
 *
 * Cost: one deep copy of the hypothesis map per step. At the demo's scale (tens
 * of rounds, tens of hypotheses) this is kilobytes. A deployment that expected
 * hundreds of rounds would want structural sharing or a diff log instead.
