      <p>
        When the differential cannot be split by reasoning alone, the engine{" "}
        <strong>proposes a test</strong> — not the test that confirms the
        favorite, but the one with the <strong>maximum information gain</strong>{" "}
        over the remaining live hypotheses. Then it pauses. The clinician owns
        the order and the result. This is the human-in-the-loop (HITL) gate.
      </p>

      <h2 className="docs-h2">The gate in the UI</h2>
      <p className="muted small">
        Source: <code>web/src/NextAction.tsx</code>. The finding form renders
        inline with the gate — no left/right ping-pong.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the engine proposes a test, the NextAction rail shows the test name
        and rationale, and the finding-entry form appears right there. Enter the
        result, pick its direction (supports / against / neutral), and click{" "}
        <strong>"Add result &amp; advance"</strong> — one action enters the
        finding and advances the next round.
      </p>

      <h2 className="docs-h2">The test proposal</h2>
      <pre className="docs-code">{`// the engine's decision is "test":
decision: {
  kind: "test",
  name: "Urgent arthrocentesis of the most inflamed joint",
  rationale: "Maximum information gain: splits septic from post-streptococcal.",
  discriminatesBetween: ["Septic arthritis", "Post-streptococcal reactive arthritis"],
}`}</pre>

      <h2 className="docs-h2">Linking the result to the test</h2>
      <p className="muted small">
        Source: <code>POST /api/cases/:id/finding</code> in <code>server/index.ts</code>.

        When the clinician enters a finding with a <code>testId</code>, the server
        marks that proposed test <code>resulted</code> and links the finding to
        it. The next round re-ranks the differential using the new finding.

        <strong>The clinician is the decider at the gate.</strong> The engine
