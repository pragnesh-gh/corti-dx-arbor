        When one hypothesis dominates and the threshold is met, the case{" "}
        <strong>converges</strong>. The clinician then sets the{" "}
        <strong>working diagnosis</strong> — the single root-cause the session
        concludes is most likely, with its confidence and the evidence path that
        reached it.

      <p>
        The engine may converge on its own (its decision is{" "}
        <code>converged</code>), or the clinician can set it when the
        differential is stable. When the leading hypothesis is clear, the detail
        panel shows a "Converged enough? <strong>Set working dx</strong>" hint —
        so the action is discoverable where you are looking at the leading
        hypothesis, not buried in a menu.

        The working diagnosis carries a <strong>reasoning trail</strong>: the path
        from the presentation down the tree to the converged hypothesis, plus the
        pruned siblings as "considered and ruled out." This is the auditable
        record a clinician retraces to defend the conclusion.
