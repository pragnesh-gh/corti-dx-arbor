        The recipe documentation lives inside this app — not in a separate site.
        The demo app is both the runnable reference and the documentation. Each
        recipe explains one building block and links to the live feature.

        These recipes are also mirrored as <strong>markdown</strong> at{" "}
        <code>docs/recipes/</code>, and the repo root has an{" "}
        <code>AGENTS.md</code> entry point — so an LLM (or a teammate) can read
        the docs without running the app. New here? Run the <strong>Guided
        tour</strong> scenario on the home page for a scripted walk-through of
        every feature.

      <ol className="docs-blocks">
        <li>
          <strong>Presentation</strong> — <code>web/src/scenarios.ts</code>. The
          seed a case branches from: chief complaint, history, observations,
          demographics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The round</strong> — <code>server/domain/engine.ts</code>. One
          pass: gather evidence → update the differential → decide what's next.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The tree</strong> — <code>web/src/DecisionTree.tsx</code>. The
          differential is a tree of hypotheses; pruned branches stay visible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The HITL gate</strong> — <code>web/src/NextAction.tsx</code>.
          When the engine proposes a test, the clinician enters the result; the
          cycle resumes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The working diagnosis</strong> — the clinician confirms the
          converged hypothesis; the reasoning trail records the path.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The treatment plan</strong> — <code>server/domain/treatment.ts</code>.
          A second agent proposes management + surgical case-finding.
        </li>
      </ol>

POST /api/cases/:id/advance

# 3. enter the test result (the HITL gate)
POST /api/cases/:id/finding  { summary, direction, testId }

        <p>
          Arbor uses a <strong>tree, not a flat list</strong>, for the
          differential. A finding that splits a hypothesis branches it into
          children; a ruled-out branch is kept (dimmed), not deleted, so the
          reasoning trail is auditable: <em>this is what I thought to arrive at
          this conclusion.</em>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Tree, not flat list</strong> — retraceability is the headline
            property. Flat lists (DXplain-style) lose the path.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>HITL, not autonomous</strong> — the clinician orders tests,
            enters results, and confirms the verdict. Clinical safety.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Model-driven merge</strong> — the LLM reasons; the server
            applies deterministic merge + normalization so the tree is always
            well-formed regardless of phrasing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Corti is the only LLM dependency</strong> — registry experts
            are the research/literature layer; no external API key.
