/**
 * Time travel — reading the case's history tape.

 * The server stores a complete case state per step (see server/domain/history.ts),

 * object from the frame and hand it to the same panels that render the present.
 * Every view — tree, ranked list, evidence, detail — then travels for free.
 *
 * The frame is the source of truth for everything that changes; the identity
 * fields (id, title, presentation) are taken from the live case because they
 * don't.
