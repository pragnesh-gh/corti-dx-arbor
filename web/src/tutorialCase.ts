/**
 * tutorialCase — the scripted, canned data for the guided tutorial route.
 *
 * The tutorial replays one coherent patient case as a sequence of full
 * `Case` snapshots. No live API is called: every snapshot is a complete
 * tree + findings + tests + verdict, so stepping is instant and the real
 * workspace components (DecisionTree, EvidencePanel, DetailPanel,
 * RankedDifferential) render real, interactive data — clicking a node
 * really opens its evidence on the right; numbers really shift between
 * steps.
 *
 * The case is the fever + migrating-joint-pain young adult. It is chosen
 * because it exercises every feature the tour must show:
 *   - an initial differential with a clear "horse" and a rare "zebra"
 *   - demographic base-rate adjustment (young adult, rural Minnesota)
 *   - a branching finding (a positive strep test splits the meaning of
 *     "post-strep" into ARF vs PSRA)
 *   - a HITL test gate
 *   - evidence with citations + the registry experts
 *   - convergence to a working diagnosis with a reasoning trail
 *   - a treatment plan with surgical case-finding
 *
 * Each step also carries teaching text: a caption, the concept to look
 * at, and (optionally) the id of the hypothesis the tour highlights.
